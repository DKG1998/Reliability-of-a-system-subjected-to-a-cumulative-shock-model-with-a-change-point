#### Abstract
Shock models play a vital role in describing the lifetime behavior of the system working
in a stochastic environment. The cumulative shock model is one of the widely studied shock
models and describes the failure of a system by additive damages given by shocks. In this
paper, we study a new cumulative shock model when the magnitudes of shocks are non-
identical over time. The proposed model assumes that the magnitude of a shock changes
after a random time, namely the change point. We discuss the mathematical expressions
for the reliability function. While closed-form expressions are unavailable, we further use
a novel matrix-based analytical approach to approximate the reliability of the system. We
present  numerical examples to illustrate our findings.
